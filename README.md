## Birthday wisher

This project aims to give you information of events,births and deaths that occured on when you were born
with a rough estimation of how many days,hours,seconds and minutes you have been breathing.

Information about deaths,births and events have been sourced from [here](https://www.timeanddate.com/) and all
credit goes to this codepen [here](https://codepen.io/shshaw/pen/KzYXvP) for the card flip animation.
Thanks to [this](https://github.com/ljlm0402/typescript-express-starter) nice typescript-express starter template
that scaffolds a node/express project with batteries included controllers,services,middlewares etc..
